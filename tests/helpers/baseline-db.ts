/**
 * The `@/lib/db` singleton, pointed at a test's own in-memory database (U1,

 *
 * This ten-line stanza was pasted identically into 38 test files. It lives here
 * now and each of them calls it in one line:
 *
 *   let testDb: import("better-sqlite3").Database | null = null;
 *   jest.mock("@/lib/db", () => require("../helpers/baseline-db").dbSingletonMock(() => testDb));
 *
 * `current` is a getter rather than the database itself, because `jest.mock` is
 * hoisted above every statement in the file: at the moment the factory is
 * built, `testDb` is still null, and it is `beforeEach` that fills it in. A
 * factory that captured the VALUE would hand every test a null database.
 *
 * `jest.requireActual("crypto")` rather than `require`, because a handful of
 * suites mock crypto to pin an id, and the singleton's `uuid` must keep
 * producing real ones regardless: it is what the repository layer writes as a
 * primary key.
