//
// Dependency-free enforcement of the laws this repo keeps breaking.
//
// WG-WEB-013 ruled that design law is enforced by "docs, plus colocated law
// headers, plus a dependency-free lint inside the standard lint command, with
// pragma escapes carrying written reasons". PatterStage shipped the docs and
// none of the lint, and the 2026-07 review found the predictable result: a
// typo'd token shipping two dead CSS classes, an entire hover treatment Tailwind
// never compiles, and an AGENTS.md instructing contributors to write custom
// properties that do not exist.
//
// A rule that is not a red build does not exist.
//
// ── The baseline ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Turning eleven rules on against 79k lines produces hundreds of failures, and a
// gate that is red on day one gets deleted rather than fixed. So violations that
// exist TODAY are recorded in design-lint.baseline.json and allowed; the gate
// fails on anything NEW, and on any file whose count grows. The baseline only
// ever shrinks: `--update-baseline` after a genuine cleanup.
//
// ── The ratchet (T-0025, warrant Q-008, drift finding D-14) ─────────────────
// That paragraph used to be the whole mechanism. --update-baseline wrote
// whatever the scan had just counted, so running it after a regression grew the
// baseline in silence, and "the baseline only ever shrinks" lived in this
// comment and in the failure text rather than in the code. Doctrine in a comment
// is not a mechanism, and the plan's risk register named a baseline grown to
// absorb violations as an all-phase risk whose only control was a person
// comparing two totals by eye.
//
// So --update-baseline now REFUSES to write a baseline whose total, or whose
// count for any single key, is higher than the committed one. The one way past
// it is `--allow-growth "<reason>"`, and the reason is recorded in the baseline
// file itself under the `__growth__` key, where the next person to open it will
// read it. This is coverage-floor-check.mjs's ratchet pointed the other way:
// that one refuses to write a DECLARED floor lower than the recorded one, this
// refuses to write a DERIVED count higher. Two gates met in the same week should
// behave the same way.
//
//   node scripts/tooling/design-lint.mjs                  # gate (runs in npm run lint)
//   node scripts/tooling/design-lint.mjs --report         # every violation, grouped
//   node scripts/tooling/design-lint.mjs --update-baseline
//   node scripts/tooling/design-lint.mjs --update-baseline --allow-growth "<reason>"
