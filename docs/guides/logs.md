# Logs

This screen reads the log files your agent writes on this machine, one file at
a time, newest line at the top.

## What you see

The header names the file you are reading. Under the title sits a line of
facts about it: the file name, how many lines it holds, its size on disk, and
how long ago it was last written to, as in `agent.log · 4213 lines · 218 KB ·
written 6s ago`. Before a file has loaded it reads "Hermes agent and gateway
logs" instead.

To the right of the header are four controls. A small refresh button turns the
five second auto-refresh on and off; it glows and spins while it is on, and its
tooltip says which state it is in. Next to it, **Lines to show** picks how much
of the file to load: 100, 200, 500 or 1000 lines. **Refresh** fetches the file
again now. **Delete All** is the destructive one, and it asks twice: the first
click changes the button to **Confirm Clear** and puts a **Cancel** beside it.
It is disabled while no log file exists.

Below the header the screen is in two columns.

On the left, under the heading **Log file**, is the list of files that exist,
with a **Filter by name…** box above it. Files are grouped under **Core**,
**System** and **Other**, with the agent's own logs first. Each row shows the
file name, its size and how long ago it changed, and a small green dot when it
was written to in the last minute, which is how you spot the file that is
moving right now. When the name filter matches nothing the list says "No
matching log files".

On the right, above the log itself, is a row of actions. **Filter lines**
opens a search box; while it is open it shows a running count of matches and
an X to close it again. **Copy** puts the lines currently on screen on the
clipboard. **Download** saves the loaded lines as a `.log` file. A **Latest
lines** pill appears only once you have scrolled down, and takes you back to
the top.

Under that, once a file with lines is open, is a strip of counts: a ring
divided into **Errors**, **Warnings** and **Info** with the total line count in
the middle, four tiles for the same three numbers plus **Lines**, and a
percentage marked **clean**, which is the share of lines not counted as errors.
Hovering any tile says exactly what it counted.

The log itself is drawn as a terminal pane. Its bar names the file and how much
of it you are looking at, as in `agent.log (showing 200/4213)`, and the lines
below sit in three columns: **Time**, **Level** and **Message**, coloured by
level. An empty file reads "Log file is empty"; a filter that matches nothing
reads "No matching lines".

## Typical use

**See what the agent is doing right now.**

1. Pick `agent` in the **Log file** list, or whichever file carries the green
   dot.
2. Leave the auto-refresh button on. The file is fetched again every five
   seconds and the view stays pinned to the newest line.
3. Scroll down to read back through it. Auto-scroll stops while you are
   reading, and the **Latest lines** pill brings you back.

**Find the error behind a failed run.**

1. Set **Lines to show** to 500 or 1000 so the window covers the period you
   care about.
2. Click **Filter lines** and type a word from the failure, a mission name or
   an error code. Only matching lines stay, the match is highlighted, and the
   count beside the box tells you how many there were.
3. Click **Copy** to take those lines with you. Copy takes what the filter has
   left on screen, so you get the lines you are looking at and nothing else.

**Keep a copy, then start the file clean.**

1. Click **Download** to save the loaded lines as `<name>.log`.
2. Click **Delete All**, then **Confirm Clear**. Every log file is emptied and
   the screen reports how many, as in "Cleared 6 log file(s)".

## Notes

- Lines are newest first. This is the opposite of reading the file in a text
  editor, so the top of the pane is the end of the log.
- You are reading a window, not the whole file. The header and the terminal bar
  both say how many lines exist behind it. Raising **Lines to show** widens the
  window; the maximum is 1000.
- **Copy** and **Download** are not the same selection. Copy takes the filtered
  lines on screen; Download saves the whole loaded window, filter or no filter,
  in the same newest-first order.
- The counts strip covers every loaded line, not the filtered view, so
  filtering narrows the pane without moving the numbers above it.
- Those counts are read off the text of each line, so they are a good guess
  rather than a tally. A line the log itself tagged wins over the words in it,
  and a line saying there were no errors is not counted as one.
- A line that carries no time of its own is shown with the file's last-write
  time, so a block of such lines can read as though it all happened at once.
- **Delete All** empties each file rather than removing it, and it cannot be
  undone. The agent keeps writing to the same files afterwards.
- On a fresh install there are no logs yet. The screen says so in a plain grey
  message, not a red one, and the files appear the first time the agent runs. A
  read that genuinely fails gets a red banner with a **Retry** button.
- Opening a log is recorded on this machine, which is what completes the "Read
  the logs" quest on [Quests](quests.md) and what the counts on
  [Insights](insights.md) are made of. Nothing about the log's contents is
  recorded, only that a file was read.
- If the logs point at something broken in the install itself, the
  [troubleshooting guide](../running/troubleshooting.md) covers the usual
  causes.

<summary>Under the hood</summary>

The screen reads `GET /api/logs?name=<basename>&lines=<n>`, which serves files
from the `logs` directory inside the agent's install root. A basename may only
contain letters, digits, dots, underscores and hyphens, and the resolved path
must stay inside that directory, so no name can walk out of it. The server caps
the request at 1000 lines and reads the tail in 64KB chunks from the end of the
file, so a multi-megabyte log is never loaded whole.

Grouping in the sidebar is by name: `agent`, `errors` and `gateway` are Core,
anything beginning `ch-` is System, everything else is Other. The green dot
means an mtime inside the last 60 seconds.

`DELETE /api/logs` truncates every log file and answers with the number
cleared; the same route accepts a `name` parameter to clear one file, which
this screen does not use. In read-only mode (`PS_READ_ONLY`) the delete is
refused before the handler runs, and no read event is recorded.

The severity rules behind the counts strip live in
`src/components/logs/log-line-severity.ts`, and the read event is
`logs.opened`, written once per successful file read.
