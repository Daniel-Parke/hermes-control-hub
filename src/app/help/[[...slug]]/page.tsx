// /help/[[...slug]] — the guides, rendered in the app that they document
//
// The first server page in the console; every other page.tsx is "use client".
// It has to be, because the corpus is read off disk: public/help/ is generated
// from docs/**.md at prebuild, and the alternative is a fetch that would be
// answering to Next's static-asset precedence rather than to us.
//
// The optional catch-all serves /help and /help/<slug> from one file, which is
// why src/app/help/page.tsx is gone: a sibling page.tsx beside [[...slug]] is a
// route conflict and the build refuses it.
//
// Nothing here throws on a missing corpus. A fresh clone has no public/help/
// until the first build, and the rail's Help entry has to lead somewhere that
// explains itself rather than to a stack trace or a 404.
