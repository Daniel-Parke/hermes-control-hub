// modules/server.ts — the composition root for server-side module capability
//
// `registry.ts` is pure data: nav, routes, flags, no React and no database, so
// the e2e route matrix can import it from plain node. That purity means it
// cannot carry FUNCTIONS, and some module capability has to be callable by core:
// clearing a module's dev data, probing its health, listing its job kinds.
//
// This file is the one place allowed to import module code. Core calls the
// capability through the interface below and never names a module, which keeps
// the `core-imports-no-module` rule enforceable everywhere else. It is the same
// shape PatterStack uses (`build_server(extra_tools=discover_product_tools())`):
// a composition root that both sides depend on, rather than a dependency from
// core to a product.
//
// Adding a module means adding one entry here, not editing whatever core code
// happened to need it.
