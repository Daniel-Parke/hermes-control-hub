 * pad itself independently of its body — one of the reasons 21 of 23 routes
 * measured an h1 that did not line up with its own content.

//
// The lock-book names two homes for a token, globals.css @theme and this file,
// and says they must agree. Two homes with nothing holding them together is how
// a mirror goes stale, so tests/unit/lockbook-tokens.test.ts reads the CSS and
// fails if either map names a token globals.css does not declare.
//
// These are the semantic names. The appearance-named spellings (bg-ps-surface-panel,
// max-w-4xl) still paint the same pixels and are still everywhere; nothing is
// repainted by declaring a name for what is already there.

// The accent maps below are written out LITERALLY, one class per entry.
//
// They used to be generated with template literals (`text-${COLOR_TEXT[c]}`).
// Tailwind scans source statically and cannot evaluate an expression, so a
// generated class only reached the stylesheet when some unrelated file happened
// to spell out the same literal. Two measured consequences on this tree:
//
//  • `hover:border-neon-cyan/60` and `focus:border-neon-*/50` produced ZERO CSS
//    rules. The border and focus-ring variants simply did not exist. A missing
//    focus ring is an accessibility defect (WCAG 2.4.7), not a cosmetic one.
//  • `border-red/40` was never a valid class at all: the token map gave bare
//    "red", and Tailwind has red-400/red-500, not `red`.
//
// The base/hover classes are also split into separate maps rather than one long
// string. The combined string previously ended in
// `hover:shadow-[0_0_20px_rgb(var(--ps-rgb-neon-cyan)_/_0.12)]`, and that
// malformed candidate took its well-formed neighbours down with it — splitting
// them is what actually made the hover and focus classes appear. The dead
// shadow is dropped rather than resurrected; it never rendered.
//
// `scripts/tooling/design-lint.mjs` (rule `no-template-literal-tailwind`) fails
// the build if the pattern returns. Keep these literal.
