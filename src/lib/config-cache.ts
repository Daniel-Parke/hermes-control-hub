// config-cache — cached reads of ~/.hermes/config.yaml
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Hot-path GET /api/config reads `~/.hermes/config.yaml` 5-10× per page load
// (config index + 1-2 section editor loads). The yaml.parse() + readFileSync
// chain costs ~3-8ms per call, dominated by yaml.parse. A SQLite-meta-keyed
// JSON cache (15s TTL) brings the steady-state cost to ~0.1ms.
//
// The cache is intentionally a separate module from `/api/config/route.ts`
// for two reasons:
//   1. The cache key strings ("config.cached_json", "config.cached_at") are
//      repeated 4× in the route — centralising them here reduces 4 strings
//      to 1 const, and a future "switch to Redis" or "switch to memjs" can
//      replace the read/write functions in this file without touching the
//      route.
//      The keys stay here; the SQL does not. The `meta` table has one
//      repository (system-repository.ts), shared with the scheduler
//      lease, so there is a single answer to "how is a meta row written".
//   2. The cache shape (read + invalidate pair) is a 2-method API — moving
//      it out of the route shrinks the route from 215 lines to ~190 lines
//      and keeps the request handler focused on HTTP shape.
//
// All failures are best-effort: a missing `meta` table (fresh DB before
// migrations run), a stale `cached_at` (TTL expired), or a corrupt cache
// JSON all fall through to the on-disk read. Cache write failures are
// silently swallowed — a missing cache just means the next read goes back
// to the filesystem, which is the same path the cache miss would have
// taken anyway.

 * THE READ IS INSIDE THE TRY, and that is the whole point of the try. It used
 * to guard yaml.load alone, so a file that existed but could not be OPENED
 * (EACCES after a chmod, EISDIR, EBUSY while another process holds it on
 * Windows) threw straight through a function whose whole contract is to report
 * trouble in `error`. Every caller inherited that: a permission problem on
 * config.yaml 500ed GET /api/models/defaults and blanked the entire Models page
 * -- table, credentials and all -- with "Failed to load registry", for data
 * that lives in SQLite and never touches this file. A file we cannot read and a
 * file we cannot parse are the same fact to every caller: we do not know what
