/**
 * Walk an error's `cause` chain, outermost first, stopping at the first

 * Node's fetch is the reason this exists. undici throws
 * `TypeError: fetch failed` and puts the only sentence worth reading one
 * level down: `Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8642`. Anything that
 * reads `.message` alone therefore reports the wrapper and discards the
 * fact, which is how a chat turn against a stopped gateway came back as
 * "fetch failed" and, further downstream, as the bare string "run failed".
 *
 * Two deliberate properties, both load-bearing:
 *
 *   * A non-Error input yields an EMPTY chain, not a wrapped one. The
 *     sibling reader `isHindsightConnectionError` is pinned on
 *     `("fetch failed")` (a bare string) being FALSE, because a string is
 *     not evidence of a transport failure. A walker that coerced its input
 *     would quietly flip that. Callers that want String() coercion compose
 *     with `toError()` first, which is exactly what `messageFromError` does.
 *   * The depth cap makes a cyclic `cause` terminate rather than hang.
 *     Self-referential causes are rare but real, and a diagnostic helper
 *     that can hang is worse than no diagnostic at all.
 *
 * This is the ONE cause walker. `src/lib/memory/hindsight-request.ts`
 * still carries a second copy of the same loop (shipped in 8247b3ab for
 * the same reason, against Hindsight rather than the gateway); that file
 * is outside this task's claims, so folding it onto this helper is a
 * separate change, not a silent one.

 * produce a non-empty string.
 *
 * It also unwraps the cause chain, joining the distinct links with ": ",
 * so `TypeError: fetch failed` reaches the user as
 * `fetch failed: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8642`. A cause whose text
 * an outer link already quotes is dropped rather than repeated: wrappers
 * that interpolate their own cause are common, and saying it twice reads

/**
 * Safe API call that unwraps the `{ data: T }` envelope in one step.
 *
 * Every PatterStage API route returns `{ data: T }` (or `{ data: T, error?: string }`).
 * `safeApiCall<T>` returns the raw envelope as `{ ok, data: T, error? }` so the
 * caller is responsible for picking the right envelope field. When the
 * caller only needs the inner `data` field (the most common case for
 * `Promise.all([...])` batched fetches and `if (data) setData(...)` updates),
 * the manual form is:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const { data } = await safeApiCall<{ data?: MonitorData }>("/api/monitor");
 * if (data?.data) setData({ monitor: data.data });
 * ```
 *
 * `safeApiCallData` collapses that to:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const monitor = await safeApiCallData<MonitorData>("/api/monitor");
 * if (monitor) setData({ monitor });
 * ```
 *
 * Byte-equivalence:
 * - `safeApiCallData<T>(path, init)` is `T | null`, identical to
 *   `((await safeApiCall<{ data?: T }>(path, init)).data?.data ?? null)`.
 *   On error (`ok: false`) `safeApiCall.data` is `undefined`, so the
 *   optional chain short-circuits to `undefined` and the `?? null` returns
 *   `null`. The helper produces the same `null` on error.
 * - On success-but-no-data (e.g. a 200 response with `{ data: null }`),
 *   the inner `data` is `undefined` and the helper returns `null` — same
 *   as the inline form.
 * - The `T` type is the inner payload, not the envelope — call sites
 *   that used `safeApiCall<{ data: SomeType }>` to express "the API
 *   returns `{ data: SomeType }`" pass `SomeType` directly here. The
 *   helper infers the envelope shape internally.
 *
 * Use `safeApiCall` when you need `ok`/`error` (e.g. mutation results with
 * toasts), or when the response shape isn't a `{ data: T }` envelope.
 * Use `safeApiCallData` for read-only fetches of a `{ data: T }` envelope.
 *
 * @example
 *   // Single fetch:
 *   const monitor = await safeApiCallData<MonitorData>("/api/monitor");
 *   if (monitor) setData({ monitor });
 *
 *   // Batched:
 *   const [status, config] = await Promise.all([
