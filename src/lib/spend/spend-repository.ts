// spend/spend-repository.ts · every statement the spend feature runs
//
// The only file in src/lib/spend/ that contains SQL (WG-ARCH-002). Nothing
// above it knows a column name, and nothing below it decides anything.
//
// ── THREE THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE EDITING ANYTHING HERE ──────────
//
// 1. NO NEW TRACKING. Every figure this feature reports is mined from rows that
//    were already being written before it existed: `runs.usage_json`, which the
//    reconcile path stamps from the runtime's own token counts, and the model
//    dimension on the linked mission. The task row was explicit that spend is
//    computed from what is already recorded, and the only honest way to hold
//    that line is for this file to add no writes except the policy itself.
//
// 2. `runs.submitted_at` CARRIES TWO DIFFERENT TIMESTAMP SHAPES. The scheduler
//    claims an occurrence through `createRun`, which passes `now()` =
//    `new Date().toISOString()` ("2026-08-23T10:00:00.000Z"). Rows inserted
//    without that argument take the column DEFAULT `datetime('now')`
//    ("2026-08-23 10:00:00"). Those do NOT compare correctly as strings: 'T' is
//    0x54 and ' ' is 0x20, so an ISO row sorts after every SQLite-shaped row on
//    the same day and a naive `>=` silently drops or admits whole days. Every
//    comparison here therefore goes through SQLite's `datetime()`, exactly as
//    retention-repository.ts does and for exactly the same reason. It costs the
//    index; a budget read that runs once per tick can afford a scan, and a
//    budget boundary that is right only on most days cannot.
//
// 3. THE JOIN TO `missions` IS A LEFT JOIN, DELIBERATELY. A Composer stage run
//    has a `composer_node_run_id` and NO `mission_id`. The Insights per-model
//    aggregate (analytics/run-aggregates.ts) INNER JOINs missions, which is why
//    Composer spend has never appeared in it at all. An inner join here would
//    reproduce that hole in the one place it would be a money error rather than
//    a chart error, so Composer stages come through with a null model and are
//    priced at model-cost's conservative default. Unknown must never read as
//    free.
