// spend/spend-law.ts · what a budget means, as pure functions
//
// LLM provider spend is the only thing in PatterStage that costs money. This
// file is the whole of what the product is allowed to conclude about it. It
// touches no database and no clock it was not handed, so every rule below is
// testable in one line, which is what tier R2 is for.
//
// ── THE OPERATOR'S RULING, WHICH IS THE DESIGN ─────────────────
//
//   "We should just have a warning here, AND the ability for the user to have a
//    hard stop, but we should not force this in a way that is awkward for
//    users."
//
// Four consequences, and each one is a function or a constant below:
//
//   1. A budget figure is OPTIONAL. `limitUsd: null` is the shipped state and
//      means "no budget". `evaluateSpend` returns `unset` for it, with no
//      message at all: an install with no figure warns about nothing, no matter
//      how much has been spent. A tool that refuses to work until you have
//      filled in a budget field teaches you to resent it.
//   2. A figure that IS set WARNS. That is the default and it is the whole of
//      the default. Nothing is blocked by a figure alone.
//   3. The HARD STOP is a second, separate switch, off until the operator
//      turns it on beside his own figure. Only then does `blocksUnattended`
//      ever become true.
//   4. It governs UNATTENDED work only. Nothing here knows about attended
//      dispatch, because attended dispatch never asks: a human clicking
//      dispatch is answering for the spend himself. See spend-guard.ts.
//
// ── WHY CALENDAR PERIODS, NOT ROLLING WINDOWS ──────────────────
//
// A person who types "40 dollars a month" means the month. A rolling 30-day
// window would put him over budget on a day he had spent nothing, because of
// what he spent four weeks ago, and there is no date on which it resets. So
// `periodStart` returns the start of the calendar day, the ISO week (Monday) or
// the calendar month, in UTC, in SQLite's own datetime format.
//
// UTC, not local time, because it is what the database stores and comparing a
// local boundary against UTC rows moves the budget's edge by the offset. The
// cost is that "today" starts at UTC midnight rather than the operator's; the
// alternative is a budget whose window silently disagrees with the rows it is
// measuring, which is worse in the one place being wrong costs money.
