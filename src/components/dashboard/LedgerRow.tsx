// LedgerRow + LedgerRowButton — the console's record row
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// WG-WEB-003 (D): a record with three or more comparable fields is a table or
// a ledger, not a rounded box. This is the ledger.
//
// The pattern is not new. ActiveMissionsPanel and ErrorsPanel have rendered it
// since the dashboard god-page was decomposed, and T-0024 set data-bloom on
// each of them by hand. Two hand-written copies of a pattern is how the third
// copy gets the attribute wrong, and T-0033's whole point is that a future
// styling ruling should reach a record surface BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by
// whoever edits it next remembering. So the pattern has one definition, here,
// and the panels that established it consume it like everyone else.
//
// Two shapes, because a row is either a fact or a control:
//
//   LedgerRow        a div. Facts, with their own links and buttons inside.
//                    Does not wash on hover unless asked, because ErrorsPanel's
//                    rows do not and ActiveMissionsPanel's do; the quieter of
//                    the two is the default.
//   LedgerRowButton  a real <button type="button">. The whole row is the
//                    control: a mission row that expands, a log file that
//                    selects, a session group that opens. Washes on hover,
//                    because it is interactive.
//
// Both answer the bloom field at the TIGHT tier. A row is short and wide, and
// the 200px field sized for a card would overflow it into a flat wash; 90px is
// the size that reads as a row lighting up. The attribute is declared BEFORE
// the prop spread, exactly as Button declares it, so a call site that needs a
// row not to answer can pass data-bloom={undefined} and win.
