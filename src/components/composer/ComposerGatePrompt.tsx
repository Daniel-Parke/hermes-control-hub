// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ComposerGatePrompt — human-in-the-loop gate for a Composer stage.
//
// Accept (→ on_approve) or Reject (→ on_reject), with an optional note. The
// older Review / Add-feature buttons were removed: they were recorded but never
// routed (Review behaved like Reject, Add-feature like Accept), so their effect
// was ambiguous. The note is persisted on the approval.
//
// The panel also shows the work: the stage's output and the verdict a reviewing
// stage reached on it. It used to take a label and nothing else, so the one
// question the product stops everything to ask was asked with nothing on screen
// to answer it by. The evidence was in the stage sheet, which is a modal dialog
// with a full-viewport backdrop, and opening it covers this panel, so reading the
// work and deciding on it could not be done at the same time.
