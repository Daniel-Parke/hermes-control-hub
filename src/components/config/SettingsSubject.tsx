// SettingsSubject — which agent these settings belong to
//
// Settings edits one file: the config.yaml of the agent at the configured
// home. Agents, Skills and Tools edit whichever profile is selected. Chapter 3
// of the quests walks an operator through all four in order, and Settings was
// the one screen that never named its subject, so an operator who had just
// given a new profile its skills and its toolsets went on to change "its"
// settings on a screen that had never heard of it (T-0113).
//
// The route cannot write another profile's file, so this does not pretend it
// can. It names the subject, and when the profile selected elsewhere is a
// different agent it says so and points at where that profile's own settings
// live: the Agents screen lists a config.yaml for every profile and opens it.
//
// Names come from the same list the pickers read, so the two screens call the
// same agent by the same name.
