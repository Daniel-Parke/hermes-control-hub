// ConceptHint — the word on the screen, and what it means
//
// Seventeen words carry this product: mission, run, gate, toolset, profile. An
// operator meets them on a screen and not in the docs, so the sentence that
// defines one has to be a press away from the word itself rather than a page
// they have to go and find.
//
// It is a disclosure, not a modal. Nothing is covered, no focus is trapped and
// the page does not stop scrolling: the panel is a small box beside the word,
// and Escape, a press elsewhere or focus leaving all put the screen back
// exactly as it was. That is also why the dialog hook is not used here — this
// control has no business joining the dialog stack for a definition.
//
// A word the corpus does not define renders as plain text with no control at
// all. public/help/ is generated at build time and git-ignored, so a fresh
// clone has no concepts whatsoever, and on those nine screens a button that
// opened an empty box would be worse than no button.
