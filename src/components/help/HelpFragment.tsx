// HelpFragment — one generated page body, in this page's own DOM
//
// Not an iframe. An iframe would need its own stylesheet, its own scroll, its
// own focus order and its own answer to every link inside it, and the operator
// would meet all four as "the docs feel bolted on". The fragment is body-only
// HTML with no <h1> (the PageHeader owns that one), so it drops straight in.
//
// This is the batch's ONLY dangerouslySetInnerHTML, which is the point of
// keeping it in a file this small: the exemption is one line with one reason
// beside it rather than a habit spread over four components.
