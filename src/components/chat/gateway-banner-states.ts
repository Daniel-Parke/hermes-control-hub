// gateway-banner-states — which connection banners the chat page shows
//
// Extracted from four nested JSX conditions in the chat page so the rule is
// something a test can read. It is a decision, not a rendering: it takes the
// probe results and the conversation state and returns the banners to draw,
// in order.
//
// THE RULE, and why it changed (P0-5). All four banners used to be gated behind
// an EMPTY chat, so the operator most likely to need one -- mid-conversation,
// having just watched a turn fail -- was the one who could not see it. The
// actionable "start it with" sentence was unreachable at exactly the moment it
// became actionable.
//
// The gate is not simply removed, because the four states are not one kind of
// thing. Two of them BLOCK the send: the gateway is off, or it refused our key.
// Those are facts about whether the product works right now, and they show
// wherever the operator is. The other two are advisory -- configuration
// guidance and a first-load spinner -- and a banner that appears above a
// working conversation every thirty seconds teaches the operator to ignore
// banners, including the two that matter.
